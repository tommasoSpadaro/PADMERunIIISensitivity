Statistical Treatment for the PADME RunIII analysis

source compileStatisticalTreatment.sh to compile <-- need to modify clang on certain machines

1 executables is obtained: runStatisticalTreatment 

./bin/runStatisticalTreatment works with a config file. Example generic config files are:

- input/config_generic.txt <-- runs standalone
  > simulates 1 pseudoevent, then use it with:
  > 200 toy-of-toy simulations.
  > Use Nuisance errors.
  > Do not assume B/epsilon curve.
  > Start with seed 0.
  > input file (POT, B, eps vs sqrt(s) handled by fitRatio.C, now using MCVersion2.

- input/config_generic_gene.txt ONLY generates 100 pseudoevents in output using MCVersion2 input.

When you want to evaluate the sensitivity for a number of pseudoevents to do the coverage, you need to:

- run scanSens.pl to execute many times config_generic with different seeds starting from a given seed number (to be changed for every production). (some seetings are in scanSens.pl)
  > produce a number of output root files equal to the number of pseudoevents (there's a tree with CLs values)
  
- run scanSens_read.pl giving the unique tag related to the production (number of mass steps and mass range) and the starting seed number (the same of the production)
  > produce 1 output root file with the UL for each input root file (UL values)
  
- rereadLimit_newsens.C you give in input the starting seed
